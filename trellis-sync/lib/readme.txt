I prefer to add jars to the project even if this makes
the project size bigger.
This way you don't need to hunt for jars nor have
jar version problems.
I'm aware that Maven was created to overcome jar hell
but is simpler, specially in small projects with few 
jar dependencies, to include the jars the way I did.
